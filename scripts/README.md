# Scripts

## challenge_fetcher

The python script in the [challenge_fetcher](./challenge_fetcher/) folder is a work-in-progress attempt to scrape all required information from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) website, and add it to the `README.md` files in [src](../src/).

I'll update this once it's fully working, for now this is straight from commit [184c20f4](https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/100_languages_template/commit/184c20f4d799d1d6115c106fe8686567d4e18db9) from my templates [dev](https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/100_languages_template/tree/dev) branch.
