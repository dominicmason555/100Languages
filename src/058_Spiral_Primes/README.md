# Problem 058: Spiral Primes

Starting with $1$ and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.

${\bf\color{red}{37}}$ 36 35 34 33 32 ${\bf\color{red}{31}}$
38 ${\bf\color{red}{17}}$ 16 15 14 ${\bf\color{red}{13}}$ 30
39 18 ${\bf\color{red}{ 5}}$  4 ${\bf\color{red}{ 3}}$ 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20 ${\bf\color{red}{ 7}}$  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
${\bf\color{red}{43}}$ 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the $13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $8/13 \approx 62\%$.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\%$?
