# Problem 028: Number Spiral Diagonals

Starting with the number $1$ and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a $5$ by $5$ spiral is formed as follows:

${\bf\color{red}{21}}$ 22 23 24 ${\bf\color{red}{25}}$  
20 �${\bf\color{red}{7}}$ �8 �${\bf\color{red}{9}}$ 10  
19 �6 �${\bf\color{red}{1}}$ �2 11  
18 �${\bf\color{red}{5}}$ �4 �${\bf\color{red}{3}}$ 12  
${\bf\color{red}{17}}$ 16 15 14 ${\bf\color{red}{13}}$  

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is $101$.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a $1001$ by $1001$ spiral formed in the same way?
