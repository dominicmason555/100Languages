# Problem 077: Prime Summations

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

$$
\begin{align}
&7 + 3\\
&5 + 5\\
&5 + 3 + 2\\
&3 + 3 + 2 + 2\\
&2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
\end{align}
$$

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
