# Problem 087: Prime Power Triples

The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is $28$. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

$$
\begin{align}
28 &= 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\
33 &= 3^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\
49 &= 5^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\
47 &= 2^2 + 3^3 + 2^4
\end{align}
$$

How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?
