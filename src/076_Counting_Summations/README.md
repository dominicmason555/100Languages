# Problem 076: Counting Summations

It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

$$
\begin{align}
&4 + 1\\
&3 + 2\\
&3 + 1 + 1\\
&2 + 2 + 1\\
&2 + 1 + 1 + 1\\
&1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
\end{align}
$$

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?
